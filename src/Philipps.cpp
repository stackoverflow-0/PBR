FFTOcean is a C++ implementation of researcher J. Tessendorf's paper
"Simulating Ocean Water". It is a real-time simulation of ocean water
in a 3D world. The (reverse) FFT is used to compute the 2D wave height
field from the Philipps spectrum. It is possible to adjust parameters
such as wind speed, direction and strength, wave choppiness, and sea depth.
